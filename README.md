As part of the Globalization course at Universidad Carlos III, I conducted this research to explore the impact of streaming platforms on cultural values. I chose this topic because understanding how these platforms shape our perceptions and identities is crucial in today's digital era.
In a rapidly globalizing world, streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ are transforming cultural values across nations. My research takes a quantitative approach, analyzing World Values Survey data and applying multiple linear regressions in Stata to measure the impact of internet penetration on cultural shifts.
Key findings:
✅ Higher internet penetration is significantly associated with a decline in traditional values—reducing the importance of religion and national pride while increasing personal autonomy and acceptance of practices like abortion.
✅ Streaming platforms contribute to a rise in self-expression values, fostering political engagement and social trust.
❌ However, the influence on happiness and post-materialist values is not significant, and factors like education and GDP per capita often play a stronger role in shaping cultural attitudes.
This study highlights how digital media accelerates cultural transformation, bridging global narratives while reshaping local traditions. 🎬🌍🚀
